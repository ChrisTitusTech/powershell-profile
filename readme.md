A stylish and functional PowerShell profile that looks and feels almost as good as a Linux terminal.

the standalone repo is [here](https://github.com/Sivivatu/powershell-profile). It is [a fork of the original](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/powershell-profile) with a few changes to make it work better for me.

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:
