# 🎨 PowerShell Profile (Pretty PowerShell)

A stylish and functional PowerShell profile that looks and feels almost as good as a Linux terminal.

## ⚡ One Line Install (Elevated PowerShell Recommended)

Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window to install the PowerShell profile:

```ps1
irm https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/powershell-profile/raw/main/setup.ps1 | iex
```
   
## Customize this profile

**Do not make any changes to the `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file**, since it's hashed and automatically overwritten by any commits to this repository.

After the profile is installed and active, run the `Edit-Profile` function to create a separate profile file [`profile.ps1`] for your current user. Add any custom code, and/or override VARIABLES/FUNCTIONS in `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` by adding any of the following Variable or Function names:

THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES RESPECT _Override:
<pre>
$EDITOR_Override
$debug_Override
$repo_root_Override  [To point to a fork, for example]
$timeFilePath_Override
$updateInterval_Override
</pre>

THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS RESPECT _Override: _(do not call the original function from your override function, or you'll create an infinite loop)_
<pre>
Debug-Message_Override
Update-Profile_Override
Update-PowerShell_Override
Clear-Cache_Override
Get-Theme_Override
WinUtilDev_Override [To call a fork, for example]
</pre>
